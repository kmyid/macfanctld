Description:  Fan control daemon for MacBook
 A customizable fan control daemon for MacBooks and Mac Minis. Macfanctld will
 keep the working temperature within resonable limits by reading the built-in
 temperature sensors and adjusting the fan speed. It is configurable, and can
 use multiple sources to determine what fan speed to set: average temperature
 from all sensors, TC0P (CPU 0 proximity temp) and TG0P (GPU 0 proximity temp).
 Each source's impact on fan speed can be individually adjusted to fine tune
 working temperature on different machines.
